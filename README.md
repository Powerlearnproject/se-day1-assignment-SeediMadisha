List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Following are the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
1. Planning Phase
- Specify project scope, goals, and deliverables
- Determine the stakeholders and their roles
- Set project time period, budget, and resources
- Develop a project plan and project schedule

2. Requirements Gathering Phase
- Collect and document software requirements from stakeholders
- Analyze and prioritize the requirements
- Document a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document

3. Design Phase
- Develop a detailed software design
- Create design architecture, components, and interfaces

4. Implementation Phase
- Write the code for the software
- Unit test and build individual components
- Combine components into a working system

5. Testing Phase
- Write and execute test plans and cases
- Find and report defects or bugs
- Conduct unit testing, integration testing, and system testing

6. Deployment Phase
- Plan and carry out the deployment of the software
- Install the production environment

7. Maintenance Phase
- Watch for and repair defects or problems
- Implement new features or capabilities

These stages are not always sequential.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Below is a side-by-side comparison of Waterfall and Agile methodologies:

Waterfall Methodology
1. Sequential and linear: Phases are completed one after the other, with no overlap.
2. Planned and predictive: Requirements are gathered beforehand, and the project plan is constructed accordingly.
3. Documentation-oriented: Detailed documentation is created before development.
4. Resistant to change: Changes in requirements are difficult and costly to implement.

Agile Methodology
1. Iterative and incremental: Development is divided into tiny cycles (sprints) with continuous improvement.
2. Adaptive and flexible: Requirements are gathered and clarified throughout the project.
3. Customer-centered and collaborative: Customers and stakeholders are involved throughout the project.
4. Change-friendly: Changes in requirements are expected and welcomed.

Waterfall situations
1. Safety-critical systems: Where requirements are well-defined and changes are dangerous (e.g., medical, aerospace).
2. Regulated domains: Where compliance with strict regulations requires an auditable and predictable process (e.g., finance, healthcare).
3. Simple, clearly defined projects: Where requirements are clear and stable (e.g., a small web development).

Scenarios for Agile
1. Innovative or experimental projects: Where requirements are unclear or changing (e.g., startup products, R&D).
2. Complex, dynamic systems: Where requirements are changing often or interacting (e.g., software as a service, IoT systems).
3. Customer-facing applications: Where user experience and feedback are significant (e.g., mobile applications, e-commerce websites).

Concisely, Waterfall suits projects with well-defined requirements, safety-critical software, and regulated domains. Agile fits projects with uncertain or changing requirements, innovative or experimental systems, and end-user facing apps.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

What is Prompt Engineering?
Prompt engineering is the process of designing, writing, and optimizing text prompts or inputs in order to achieve desired, specific outputs from artificial intelligence (AI) models, even more so language models. It demands that one must have an understanding of the strengths, weaknesses, and biases of AI models and come up with prompts that would readily communicate the intended task, context, and requirements.

Importance of Prompt Engineering
Prompt engineering is crucial when working with AI models because of several reasons:
1. Improved Accuracy: Well-designed prompts can significantly improve the relevance and accuracy of responses from AI models.
2. Reduced Ambiguity: Short and specific prompts reduce ambiguity, with AI models understanding the task and providing targeted responses.
3. Improved Efficiency: Effective prompts can make the process more efficient, reducing the number of iterations or clarifications required.

Primary Concerns in Prompt Engineering
1. Brevity and Clarity: Prompts should be concise, clear, and free from ambiguity.
2. Context and Background: Provide relevant context and background information to help AI models understand the task.
3. Specificity and Detail: Provide specific details and specifications to guide AI model responses.

Through prompt engineering, individuals are able to maximize AI models, achieving more accurate, productive, and creative outcomes.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vagur Prompt:
"Write a story about a character who learns something new."

Improved Prompt
"Write a 2-page short story about a 10-year-old girl who discovers she has a secret talent for painting at a summer art camp. Include vivid descriptions of her artistic process and emotional journey."

Why the Better Prompt is More Effective
1. Specificity: The new prompt provides specific details regarding the character (age, gender), setting (summer art camp), and plot (discovering a hidden talent).
2. Clarity: The prompt is concise in stating what is needed (2-page short story) and provides a brief summary of the story's requirements.
3. Conciseness: The new prompt gets straight to the point, avoiding unnecessary words and focusing on the main elements of the story.
4. Context: The prompt gives context regarding the emotional arc and artistic process of the character, allowing the writer to know the tone and direction of the story.

By giving a clear, concise, and specific prompt, you heighten the chances of getting a quality response that will satisfy your expectations.
